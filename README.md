Space Challenge

In this project, you will build a simulation that will help us with our mission to Mars!
The mission is to send a list of items (Habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers) to Mars, but we need to run some simulations first to pick the correct fleet of rockets.
We've already designed 2 rocket prototypes, but we need your help to design and run some simulations to help us decide which type to use.


U-1
The U-1 Rocket is light weight, agile and pretty safe, but can only carry a total of 18 tonnes of cargo. It costs $100 Million to build and weighs 10 tonnes. It has a slim chance of crashing while landing but a bigger chance of exploding when launching, both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried in the rocket.

U-2
The U2 Rocket heavier than the U-1 but much safer and can carry a lot more cargo; to a total of 29 tonnes. However, it costs $120 Million to build and weighs 18 tonnes. It has a greater chance of crashing while landing than while launching, but just like the U-1 both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried.


The Mission
The mission consists of 2 phases:
Phase-1:
This phase is meant to send building equipment and construction material to help build the colony. In the resources tab, you will find a text file that contains the list of all items that we need to send called 'Phase-1.txt`. Each line in the file contains the item name as well as its weight in Kgs.

The file has:
building tools=2000 
building tools=2000 
building tools=2000 
building tools=5000 
building tools=5000 
building tools=2000 
building tools=1000 
building tools=5000 
building tools=6000 
shelter equipment=5000 
construction equipment=5000 
plants=1000
steel=8000
books=1000
water=5000
